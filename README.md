# ImageCombiner

ImageCombiner is a simple tool to combine multiple images into a single larger one. 
Written in C# using WinForms.

## Usage

1. Add one or more images using the "Open" button. 
2. Put them in the order using the ↑ and ↓ buttons.
3. (Optional) Use the options in the border box to add a border between the images.
4. Press "Generate Image" to generate and preview the image.
5. Press "Save" to save the final image.

## TO-DO

* Add progress bars for image generation and move it to a separate thread.
* Fix memory issues (large images fill memory up really fast)
* Better image preview (zooming, etc.)
* More error handling
